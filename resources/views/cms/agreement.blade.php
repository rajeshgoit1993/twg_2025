User(s) agree to be bound by all the conditions as contained in booking confirmation or as laid out in the confirmed booking voucher.

<p>In cases of short charging of the booking amount, taxes, statutory fee, convenience fee etc., owing to any technical error or other reason, TWG shall reserve the right to deduct, charge or claim the balance amount from the User and the User shall pay such balance amount to TWG. In cases where the short charge is claimed prior to the utilization of the booking, TWG will be at liberty to cancel such bookings if the amount is not paid before the utilization date.</p>

<h3 style="color: red">TERMS OF SERVICE</h3>
<h4>FLIGHT TICKETS</h4>
<h5>TERMS OF THE AIRLINES</h5>
<p>The airline tickets available through the Website are subject to the terms & conditions of the concerned airline, including but not limited to cancellation and refund policies.</p>
<p>TWG merely acts as a facilitator to enable the User to book a flight ticket. The contract of service for utilization of the flight is always between the User and the concerned airline.</p>
<p>Airlines retain the right to reschedule flight times, route, change or cancel flights or itineraries independent of and without prior intimation to TWG. As a facilitator TWG has no control or authority over the logistics of the airlines and therefore is not liable for any loss, direct or incidental, that a User may incur due to such change or cancellation of a flight.</p>
<p>Different tickets on the same airline may carry different restrictions or include different services and price.</p>
<p>The baggage allowance on given fare is as per the terms decided by the airline, and TWG has no role to play in the same. Some of the fares shown in the booking flow are "hand baggage fares" which do not entitle the User for free check in baggage and therefore the User will be required to pay separately for check in baggage. The prices for adding check-in baggage to a booking may vary from airline to airline. The User is advised to contact the airlines for detailed costs.</p>
<h5>CODE SHARE</h5>
<p>Some airlines enter into "code share" agreements with other Airlines. This means that on certain routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the flight ticker does not fly its own aircraft to that destination. Instead, it contracts or partners with another airline to fly to that destination. The partner airline is listed as "operated by" in the booking flow.</p>
<p>If your flight is a code share, it will be disclosed to you in the booking process and prior to payment.</p>
<p>TWG will disclose any such code-share arrangements to the User, only when the ticketing airline discloses it to TWG in the first place.</p>
<h5>PRICING</h5>
<p>The total price displayed on the Website on the payment page usually includes base fare, applicable government taxes and convenience fee. Users are required to pay the entire amount prior to the confirmation of their booking(s). In the event the User does not pay the entire amount, TWG reserves its right to cancel the booking. User agrees to pay all statutory taxes, surcharges and fees, as applicable on the date of travel.</p>
<p>To avail infant fares, the age of the child must be under 24 months throughout the entire itinerary. This includes both onward and return journeys. If the infant is 24 months or above on the return journey, User will be required to make a separate booking using a child fare. Any infants or children must be accompanied by an adult as per the terms of the airlines.</p>
<h5>TRAVEL DOCUMENTS</h5>
<p>It shall be the sole responsibility of the User to ensure they are in possession of valid travel documents such as identity proof, passport, visa (including transit visa) etc. to undertake the travel. User agrees that in case of inability to travel for not carrying valid travel documents, TWG shall in no way be held liable.</p>
<p>User understands that the information (if any) provided by TWG regarding the travel documents is only advisory in nature and can't be considered conclusive. The User shall ensure checking the requirements of travel with the respective airlines of the respective jurisdictions the User may transit through or choose to visit.</p>
<h5>CHECK-IN TERMS</h5>
<p>User should check with the airlines directly regarding the check-in timings. Usually, check-in begins 2 hours before departure for domestic flights, and 3 hours before departure for international flights.</p>
<p>User should carry valid identification proofs, passport, age proofs as may be required to prove the identity, nationality and age of the passengers travelling on a ticket, including infants.</p>
<h5>USE OF FLIGHT SEGMENTS</h5>
<p>In the event User does not embark on the onward journey, the entire PNR pertaining to that booking shall be automatically cancelled by the airline. In such a scenario TWG has no control in the said process nor will be obligated to provide alternate bookings to the User. The cancellation penalty in such an event shall be as per the applicable airline rules.</p>
<h5>CHANGES TO EXISTING BOOKING</h5>
<p>Any changes that are made to any existing booking shall be subject to certain charges levied by the respective airline, apart from the service fee charged by TWG.</p>

<h4>FLIGHT TICKETS</h4>
<h5>TERMS OF THE AIRLINES</h5>
<p>The airline tickets available through the Website are subject to the terms & conditions of the concerned airline, including but not limited to cancellation and refund policies.</p>
<p>RTA merely acts as a facilitator to enable the User to book a flight ticket. The contract of service for utilization of the flight is always between the User and the concerned airline.</p>
<p>Airlines retain the right to reschedule flight times, route, change or cancel flights or itineraries independent of and without prior intimation to RTA. As a facilitator RTA has no control or authority over the logistics of the airlines and therefore is not liable for any loss, direct or incidental, that a User may incur due to such change or cancellation of a flight.</p>
<p>Different tickets on the same airline may carry different restrictions or include different services and price.</p>
<p>The baggage allowance on given fare is as per the terms decided by the airline, and RTA has no role to play in the same. Some of the fares shown in the booking flow are "hand baggage fares" which do not entitle the User for free check in baggage and therefore the User will be required to pay separately for check in baggage. The prices for adding check-in baggage to a booking may vary from airline to airline. The User is advised to contact the airlines for detailed costs.</p>
<h5>CODE SHARE</h5>
<p>Some airlines enter into "code share" agreements with other Airlines. This means that on certain routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the flight ticker does not fly its own aircraft to that destination. Instead, it contracts or partners with another airline to fly to that destination. The partner airline is listed as "operated by" in the booking flow.</p>
<p>If your flight is a code share, it will be disclosed to you in the booking process and prior to payment.</p>
<p>RTA will disclose any such code-share arrangements to the User, only when the ticketing airline discloses it to RTA in the first place.</p>
<h5>PRICING</h5>
<p>The total price displayed on the Website on the payment page usually includes base fare, applicable government taxes and convenience fee. Users are required to pay the entire amount prior to the confirmation of their booking(s). In the event the User does not pay the entire amount, RTA reserves its right to cancel the booking. User agrees to pay all statutory taxes, surcharges and fees, as applicable on the date of travel.</p>

If the infant is 24 months or above on the return journey, User will be required to make a separate booking using a child fare. Any infants or children must be accompanied by an adult as per the terms of the airlines.</p>
<h5>TRAVEL DOCUMENTS</h5>
<p>It shall be the sole responsibility of the User to ensure they are in possession of valid travel documents such as identity proof, passport, visa (including transit visa) etc. to undertake the travel.

<p>In the event User does not embark on the onward journey, the entire PNR pertaining to that booking shall be automatically cancelled by the airline. In such a scenario RTA has no control in the said process nor will be obligated to provide alternate bookings to the User. The cancellation penalty in such an event shall be as per the applicable airline rules.</p>
<h5>CHANGES TO EXISTING BOOKING</h5>
<p>Any changes that are made to any existing booking shall be subject to certain charges levied by the respective airline, apart from the service fee charged by RTA.</p>
<p>The User shall be obligated to pay applicable charges in the event of any alteration or modification to an existing booking. However, depending on the airline's policy and fare class, charges for changes or modifications to existing bookings may vary.</p>
<h5>REFUND</h5>
<p>Refunds will be processed as per the airline fare rules and cancellation policy. Such refunds shall be subject to RTA receiving the same from the airlines. However, the convenience fee paid to RTA paid at the time of booking is a non-refundable fee.</p>
<p>All cancellations made directly with the airline need to be intimated to RTA, in order to initiate the process of refund. The processing time for refunds may vary depending on the mode of payment, bank etc. The refund shall be processed after deducting the RTA service fee which is independent of the convenience fee as mentioned above.</p>
<p>The refund will be credited to the same account from which the payment was made. For example, if the User used a credit card, RTA will make an appropriate charge reversal to the same credit card; like-wise if the User used a debit card, RTA will credit the money to the same debit card.</p>
<p>In the event of cancellation and refund of partially utilized tickets, upfront discount and promo code discount availed at the time of booking would be deducted from the refund amount.</p>

<p>In case of publication of any travel scheme offering any discount or benefit by RTA, RTA shall have the sole right to withdraw such a scheme or discount at any time.</p>
<h5>TOUR ARRANGEMENTS & OTHER ACTIVITIES</h5>
<p>For tour arrangements like carnival, cosmos, star cruise, amusement parks, museums etc., the terms and conditions specified by such respective entities shall also be applicable.</p>
<p>It shall be the responsibility of the User to reach the place of commencement of the tour and register with the representative of RTA/ tour guide/ tour manager at the appointed place, date and time.</p>
<p>If a User avails pre-tour services or part thereof, or the air tickets (cost of which is included in the main tour cost) but fails to join the group for the main tour at the appointed place, or cancels the tour after using the air tickets or pre-tour arrangements or part thereof, it shall be treated as "no show" and there will be no refund whatsoever for the unutilized pre-tour or main tour services.</p>
<p>RTA cannot be held liable for any hazard to the health, safety and well-being of the User in the course of availing any or all activities including adventure sports, Amusement park & rides, ferry ride, sightseeing or any other activity that may pose a threat of death or injury taken up by the User as a part of the OBT or on his own while on the OBT. Any incidental damage or loss, injury, accident, death etc. suffered in the due course of any such activity shall be at the sole risk and liability of the User attributable to RTA.</p>
<h5>MISCELLANEOUS</h5>
<p>RTA reserves the right to withdraw tour membership of any User whose behavior is deemed likely to affect the smooth operation of the outbound tour or adversely affect the enjoyment or safety of other passengers. RTA shall not be liable for any damages due to such withdrawal.</p>
<p>It is a mandatory condition of booking that the User purchases a holiday insurance.</p>
<p>A transfer from one tour to another prior to the departure of the originally booked tour will be treated as a cancellation of the original tour and would attract the cancellation charges as stated hereunder and a fresh booking would have to be made at the prevalent rates.</p>
